# Information for Recent College Graduates (which has morphed into "Introduction to Investing")

> *Note*:  If you're reading this via straight Github, it is also now available in an easier to read format at [jotpowers.github.io](https://jotpowers.github.io/ds/docs/introduction).  This is as a result of Vidit opening [this issue](https://github.com/jotpowers/College-Grads/issues/1). If you're reading this via Github Pages, then the bare repo is available [here](https://github.com/jotpowers/College-Grads).

The information in here started when I had several RCGs that were starting to work for me.  Now, some of it was very specific to the company I was working for, but over time, it because a document that people were referring to for a lot of different things, primarily due to the finance information/opinions in it.

Then it grew to the point where I decided it probably needed to be crowdsourced, but the discussion was how.  And now we have it on [Github](https://github.com/jotpowers/College-Grads).  Yes, I'll take pull requests.  

## tl;dr
I've created that over in the [simple version](simple.md) if you just want to get started.  This will give you 90% of the value at about 10% of the effort.

## Overview
I graduated so long ago that the basics of how to incorporate into corporate America are so second nature that I forget about all the questions I had at the time.  So, here are the thoughts that I find myself distilling down for my RCGs when they join the team.

**Note:** These are my opinions.  Other people might have different ones.  Maybe people like you, so make sure you do your own research and, when in doubt, ask someone who does this stuff for a living.

* [Healthcare](healthcare.md) - Navigating the U.S. healthcare setup
* [Insurance](insurance.md) - Primarily around life insurance for now
* [Retirement](retirement.md) - Things to think about from a lifestyle perspective.  What do you hold your investments in?
* [Investing](investing.md) - "Truths" of investing and market timing
  * [Equities](equities.md) - Discussion on the specific asset classes that you put money into 
     * More detailed (but perhaps overly simple) discussion on the [stock market](stock-market.md)
  * [Real Estate](realestate.md) - One of the investing options, in depth
  * [Liquidity](liquidity.md) - Discussion on the premium you should get for not having easy access to your money.
  * [Personal Results](results.md) - Personal example (so N=1) of actual results using these strategies
* [Taxes](Taxes/taxes.md) - High level overview of taxes.  Not sure where this is going to end up longer term.
