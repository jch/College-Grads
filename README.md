# Information for Recent College Graduates
*(which has morphed into "Introduction to Investing")*


> *Note*:  If you're reading this via straight Github, it is also now available in an easier to read format at [jotpowers.github.io](https://jotpowers.github.io/).  This is as a result of Vidit opening [this issue](https://github.com/jotpowers/College-Grads/issues/1). If you're reading this via Github Pages, then the bare repo is available [here](https://github.com/jotpowers/College-Grads).

The information in here started when I had several Recent Colleges Grads (RCG) that were starting to work for me.  Now, some of it was very specific to the company I was working for, but over time, it became a document that people were referring to for a lot of different things, primarily due to the finance information/opinions in it.

Then it grew to the point where I decided it probably needed to be crowdsourced, but the discussion was how.  And now we have it on [Github](https://github.com/jotpowers/College-Grads).  Yes, I'll take pull requests.  

## tl;dr
I've created that over in the [simple version](simple.md) if you just want to get started.  This will give you 90% of the value at about 10% of the effort.

## Overview
I graduated so long ago that the basics of how to incorporate into corporate America are so second nature that I forget about all the questions I had at the time.  So, here are the thoughts that I find myself distilling down for my RCGs when they join the team.

:::tip
These are my opinions.  Other people might have different ones.  Maybe people like you. So make sure you do your own research and, when in doubt, ask someone who does this stuff for a living, but doesn't charge you 1 to 2%.

I've struggled over time with how to organize this.  As an example, investing is something you do in retirement accounts and in other ways, so where does it belong? My current plan is to break it up into:

* Brief introduction (this)
* [Spending](spending.md) - Things you have to spend money on
* [Saving](saving.md) - Order of how to save money
* [Investing](investing.md) - Details of where your money could be put.  This could be in either the "Spending" or "Saving" buckets.
