# Housing
America has a really weird fixation on home ownership.  As we’ll see (later on in this document), single-family home ownership is not the clear path to wealth.  It actually underperforms the S&P 500 over the long haul.  But, none of that matters, we still want to own houses.  So, let’s talk through why, and what the financial considerations are.

  Note:  When we talk about home “ownership”, for the most part we’re actually talking about paying a bank to own a home, and at the end of a very long time, then you actually own it.

# Tax Benefit
In the U.S. most of us are still allowed to take the mortgage interest deduction off of our taxes.  But, let’s be crystal clear on what that net effect is (The calculations are provided in the [Introduction to Investing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y3HWSfN4bGt7S5OjlKtTXmiEOeoyn44JVXM31QebP1w/edit#gid=361119383) Google sheet.  Yes, you can get much more sophisticated, I'm just trying to provide basics)

* Mortgage: $100,000
* Mortgage term: 30 years
* Interest rate: 5%
* Tax rate: 25%
* First year taxes back: $1,250

So, failing to account for appreciation (less than stock market) you make 1.25% back in taxes.  Might be enough to offset the stock market delta (which will be .3% when you get further down).   Of course, you’ve paid 5% to another company to service that debt, which puts you back in the hole…

The obvious risk though, is the costs of home ownership.  If (oh, sorry, when) things break they can easily wipe out any gain.

# Stability
This is the big one.  You have to live somewhere.  A prime advantage of “owning” a home is that you’ve negotiated the terms of payment for a very, very long time.  Let’s be honest, 30 years is close to 40% of the average American life span.  The chances that you pay it off in that time are slim.  You’re more likely to sell and buy another house, thus staying on the treadmill, or just move.  But, the advantages of having a stable known payment, where landlords can’t up the prices or kick you out, has a very clear psychological advantage.

# Leverage (aka Borrowing)
Another advantage is how much money you have to put out, in order to recognize returns.  This would be options in the stock market, or loans in commercial real estate, but somehow it feels way less speculative when it’s your house.  Also, the (U.S.) government fundamentally subsidizes these loans (through Fannie Mae, Freddy Mac).  Leverage allows you to generate returns greater than your investments, and normally causes you to have more risk.  In this case, that is less likely.
