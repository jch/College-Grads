When you looking at your ability to save, you should try to fill these buckets, in this order.  It is well laid out in the [flowchart](spending.md) as well.

* [Emergency Fund](emergency.md) - Money to allow you to weather moderate disasters
* [Pre-tax](pre-tax.md) - Money you can put away before the government taxes it
* [After-tax](after-tax.md) - It's already been taxed, but can grow tax free/deferred
* [Taxable](taxable.md) - The goverment has already taken their cut, and will in the future, but it can still grow

Now, this focuses a lot on the tax treatment, because it represents a way to get better returns.  Do **not** take this as advice that you should actually focus on reducing taxes.  You should be focusing on where you are [investing](investing.md) and investing as much as you can, and these are just the buckets you fill to optimize your returns.
