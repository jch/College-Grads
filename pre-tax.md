*Note*:  This is an early work in progress.

After an [emergency fund](emergency.md), this is the first savings bucket you want to fill.  This is because it generally allows you to avoid paying taxes and your current rate.  When you retire there is a 90+% chance you're going to be paying less in taxes, so you make money overall on this.

So, let's talk through this, because it represents a change [from my past](https://github.com/jotpowers/College-Grads/commit/d8f27a856f201d6dcdc6b5c28e34de5662650cf7#diff-a50bcc4820918ed9d6d0daa6fe8c473e8bbd7b8435c9bc066864885bebcd7d09). This is one of the advantages of GitHub, you can watch the evolution of thought and decided whther or not I'm an idiot or not.

## Truth in Advertising

Honestly, I have been in a place where I wonder if my assets after W-2 (i.e. employed by someone else) would not exceed my W-2 life.  The answer is:  Yeah, that seems unlikely.

Even if you are *extremely* lucky and you can plan on a retirement income greater than your W-2 income, the chances are that your tax rates will be less.  In particular, because long term capital games are not ordinary income.  So, if you can reduce your current income by your current income tax percentage, that is likely to result in a net gain versus your future income tax percentage (which be much lower on a higher standard of living).
