## Introduction

This might be very plan and company specific, but my company uses Charles Schwab for our 401k.  In general, I'm a Schwab fan.  Heck, I've even worked for them, but there are a few places they could use some help.  

* Their UI often earns the harshest criticism I can ever level at a UI;  It looks like something I could design.
* Their descriptions of options is unnecessarily confusing.

Now, I suspect this is a combination of what my company has given them and how they've implemented it, so I have no idea if this is a problem across their whole ecosystem, but I'm tired of explaining it, so I'm just going to document it for everyone.

> **Note**:  Even though this might be company specific, I'm putting it out here so that people can have access to the information when they aren't on the company intranet.

## Bonus Pay
Bonus has two portions. 

* Annual Incentive Plan (i.e. company bonus)
* Other bonus (sales, spot awards, etc.)

Most of us are on the AIP so that has the most relevance, but if you get bonuses (sales, spot awards, etc) then the "Bonus" section applies. AIP is the (currently) February bonus payout.
