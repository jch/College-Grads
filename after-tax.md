Congratulations.  You've made it to the promised land.  Here it makes sense to put *post*-tax dollars into savings so that you can transfer them and they can grow tax-free forever.  This includes:

* After-tax 401k contributions that you [Mega Backdoor Roth](https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/investing/mega-backdoor-roths-work)

It could be that you can't grow them tax free, but it still makes sense to have a brokerage account.  Choose someplace logical to own your index funds.  I think the most popular are probably going to be:

* [Schwab](https://www.schwab.com)
* [Etrade](https://www.etrade.com)
