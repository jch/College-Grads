## Solo 401k

If you don't work for someone else, but bring in money, it might be useful to have a solo401k.  Especially if you're looking to do a 'backdoor roth' you can use it as a vehicle to move your traditional IRA money out of the way of Roth conversions.  This is one of my primary goals, so I need to make sure the provider allows it.
