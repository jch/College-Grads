## What I Do

I know a lot of these discussions seem a little abstract, and it’s really easy to read what people say you should do, but what do they do, and does it work?  So, to that end, here is what I do.

**Note:**  Updated in late 2020 for how my portfolio has changed.  Look at file history to see what it was and the evolution of thought.

## Investments

* Most of my investments are in low-cost broad index funds.  In particular I own VTSAX in a brokerage account and VIIX in my 401k (because it's the best available option).  This represents rougly 2/3rds of my market portfolio.
* I'm putting more money into VEU because I'm higher on the risk side of the [efficient frontier](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/efficientfrontier.asp) than I need to be, so will slowly add there.   I expect this to be instead of more bond allocations, slowly skewing me back towards higher risk.
* I have the remaining 1/3rd in low cost index bond funds.  In partidular VBTIX. I'm more heavily weighted here than I have been in the past because I'm less tolerant of volatility as I get closer to retirement.  I hold these entirely in retirement accounts, because dividends from bonds are taxes as ordinary income, so if I can have that in retirement accounts and equities in brokerage I can have the non-retirement accounts dividents be taxed as capital gains.
* My 401k is a traditional (i.e. pre-tax) 401k.  This is change because as I've looked at my retirement plans, the chances that my post retirement tax rate will be even close to my W-2 rate is miniscule.  So, I'd rather get the advantage of saving the taxes now.
* I have a handful of "passive" [real estate](realestate.md) investments.  I'm slowly unwinding these because I don't see the advantages vs the risk potential of loss.  I have enjoyed the income showing up in my account, but still not worth it to me.
* I utilize both backdoor Roths and Mega Backdoor Roths (worst bandname ever).
  * My company 401k changed to allow me to roll all existing IRAs into my 401k to allow me to escape the pro-rata rule.  (I also mistakenly rolled in post-tax dollars, which you should avoid.  If you don't know what that means, this is your clue to do more research.)
  * The 401k also allows for me to do after-tax contributions that I can then roll into a Roth 401k (this is the mega backdoor).
  * I contribute the maximum amount possible to a traditional IRA at the beginning of the year and then convert it to Roth (backdoor Roth).

## What I'm Going to Do

* I expect over the next few years I will unwind all of the real estate because I don't see that the return is better than equities, the risk is higher, the liquidity is lower and it's not as interesting to me.

## What I Did

* I used to have individual stocks.  I bought them nearly 20 years ago when I had the hubris to think that I could be good at picking stocks.  I finally liquidated all of them, and the results are about what you would expect.
  * I lost money outright on one.
  * I underperformed the broader market on all but one of the remaining.
  * I likely lost money due to the cost of inflation on most of them.
  * I crushed the market on one of them.

So, in summary, I had random results and had some good outcomes and bad outcomes, but the decision making process was suspect at best.

## Sample Results

I worked for a company from September of 2003 until May of 2006.  In that time, I contributed to my 401k, entirely into index funds.  (Maybe not the best ones, but we all learn).  I haven’t rolled this over to something else, so it provides a great view into a single long-term investment.

The thin line at the bottom is my total contributions.  The blue line at the top is total value of the portfolio.  The little red markers are when I made a change to allocations.

My cumulative personal return is just under 175%, which annualizes to 6%.

You’ll notice that when the Great Recession hit in 2008, the value of the portfolio was actually worth less than the amount of money I had put in.  But, in less than 2 years it had recovered and it took nearly 6 years to recover to the highs of 2007, but it has continued to climb.

So, here is an actual example of how a long term buy and hold strategy for index funds works in the real world.

But how did I do compared to the S&P 500?  Well, good but not great?  From January of 2004 until September of 2020, S&P 500 total return was 197% with an annualized return of 6.8%.  So seems like I did ok!  What about with dividends reinvested?  312% and 8.9%, so maybe I didn’t do that great (S&P 500 Return Calculator, with Dividend Reinvestment, 2020).  I will say, I think part of it is because I didn’t have enough low cost, index funds, something I have slowly fixed in the last few years.  But, in spite of that, I have managed to at least pace the market, for this investment.
