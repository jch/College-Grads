# Retirement

Probably a better question that "What is retirement?" is "Why is retirement?".  Ok, that doesn't make any sense, but I'm going with it anyway.  So, why do you want to retire, and what does it mean?

For most of us, I think it really means "I have enough money that I can do what I want (within reason), without having to compromise due to a limited amount of time."  In other words, "I don't have to work and I can still spend money."

There are a few challenges with this, and in full transparency, I don't have answers to some of them.

* The older you get, the less inclined you are to do new things (including travel)
  * I've seen this in multiple generations.  No matter how much you love to travel, and how much you want to do it, as you approach a certain age, the comfort of being at home and the routine and normalcy mean that you're not going to willing to travel people you want to see, much less things you've never seen.
* The older you get, the more health problems (stupid back) limit your ability to do what you want
  * Here there are a few things at play.  Everyone seems to love their doctors.  They're always the best at what they do.  And you hurt.  And ... fact is doctors everywhere are good.  But, the longer you wait, the higher the likelyhood is that you can't do what you want.  Save all your money until you're 70 and die at 71?  Seems sort of pointless, no?
* What the heck are you going to do?
  * So, you love traveling, but there are other hobbies too.  Do those.  Find any hobby that you want to do for 40 hours a week.  That's what we call a job.  Make sure you've gotten to the space in your head that allows you to be doing different things and not getting bored.
* How can you deal with the fact that you're spending your nest egg, instead of accumulating it?
  * For >30 years you have gained satisfaction out of watching your nest egg grow.  It brings you comfort that you know you can spend money without touching it, because you're still earning money.  Uh-oh.  Now you're actually watching it shrink.  Do you have the ability to change your frame of reference to make that a good thing?


With all of that said, here are the standard ways to save for retirement.

## 401(k)
This is the best corporate investing options.  So named for the portion of the US Tax Code it is defined in, as well as a count of the numbers of reasons you don't care why it's named what it is.
You contribute either pre-tax or post-tax money (more details below) with the earnings on the account growing tax free or tax deferred.
Most companies will match a percentage of your salary.  Regardless of anything else, you should do at least that.
You have the option of a Roth or Traditional 401k.  In general I think a Roth is likely going to work out better because over a long period of time, hopefully you'll retire rich.

### Roth vs Traditional
So, which one should you do?  If there were a straightforward answer, the other one would never get mentioned, so it isn't a simple answer.  Essentially what you're trying to figure out is whether or not you'll be in a higher or lower tax bracket when you retire.
#### Traditional
Contributions are pre-tax.  But no one gets away without paying taxes eventually, so you will pay taxes when you withdraw at your tax rate at that time.  (Tax deferred)
* Your bet:  Your tax rate when you retire is going to be lower than your current tax rate.
#### Roth
Contributions are after-tax.  So you've paid your taxes already and you get to withdraw tax free.
* Your bet:  Your tax rate now is lower than it will be when you retire.

Now, there are a few other advantages to a Roth.
* You are not forced to take distributions at 70 1/2 like you are for traditional.  Ok, really, you **are** required to take them if you keep your money in the Roth 401k.  **BUT** if you roll it over into a Roth IRA (why not) it doesn't have this limitation, so you can pass it on to heirs, if you're so lucky.
* You can withdraw your contributions without penalties (but you shouldn't).  Because your money was contributed post-tax, it can be withdrawn without incurring penalties.  At least that's the reason we ascribe to it.  In reality, trying to decipher why anything is anyway in our tax code is a fool's errand.

## Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)
The above information also applies to IRAs as well, but with further caveats.  Your ability to contribute to an IRA when you also have a work sponsored plan is limited.  They can also be income limited, so pay attention.  This probably falls into the "advanced financial planning" category and beyond the scope of this backgrounder.  You start getting into things like "mega backdoor Roth" which is probably the worst metal band name ever.
